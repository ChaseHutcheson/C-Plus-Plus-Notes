#include <iostream>


// You need semicolons btw.
int main(){

    // "std" stands for standard, and "cout" is character output. So std::cout is standard character output
    // "<<" means insertion. so "Hello world" is inserted into the output stream
    
    std::cout << "Hello, World. \n";
    std::cout << "Hello, C++. ";

    return 0; // If 0 is returned, the function ran without issue. if 1, there was an error
